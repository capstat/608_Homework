    <h1>Staten Island's Crime Rates</h1>
    <div id="post">
    	<p>
        What's so amazing about <a href="pop_stat_island.html">Staten Island's population boom</a> is that, during this same time period, crime rates have decreased.  Staten Island has been able to double its size and remain the safest place to live in New York City.
      </p>
      <p>
       	My Father-in-Law, a life long Staten Islander, remembers the first time a Staten Island murder was covered in the newspaper, <a href="http://nomadicjoe.blogspot.com/2009/10/life-magazine-strange-case-of-nimer.html">the sensational Nimer case</a>.  At the time, it was unbelieavble that such an incident could occur on Staten Island.  The Island was a quiet place.  It was only reachable by Manhattan via ferry.  Violent crimes were rare (and still are) when compared to other cities of the same population.    
      </p>
      <p>
      	However, recently, these low crime rates are being threatened.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/us/politics/fbi-chief-links-scrutiny-of-police-with-rise-in-violent-crime.html">Crime rates for cities across the country have crept up</a> since the summer of 2015.  Local law enforcemnet is doing everything possible to keep rates steady. This may prove difficult. Staten Island is suffering from <a href="http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/da_9_fatal_drug_overdoses_on_s.html">America's opioid drug epidemic</a> and will have challenges dealing with the influx of people that current developments are projected to bring to the Island.
